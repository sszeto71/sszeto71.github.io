      <h1><b>Pair Programming</b></h1>
      <h3>Benefits of Pair Programming</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to collaborate and learn from other progammers</li>
          <li>With additional sets of eyes will translate to better QA, testing, and more efficient coding</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps to Successful Pair Programming</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand their definition of being a driver and navigator</li>
          <li>Pair programming is defined being with 2 programmers working together off of the same code</li>
          <li>Navigator is responsible for defining the code being written, checking for syntax error, reseaching new ideas, guding the driver</li>
          <li>Driver is responsible to entering the code, mindful of error, and collaboring on the solution</li>
        </ol>          
      <h3>Pros and Cons of Pair Programming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pros</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Great way to quickly bring new programmers up-to-speed</li>
          <li>Even for seasoned programmers, it's a great way to learn other people's best practices and approaches so that they can incorporate into their own style</li>
          <li>Better QA and reduce code error</li>
        </ul>  
        <li>Cons</li>
        <ul>
          <li>For seasoned programmers, it reduces their efficiency and productivity because they typically like to work on their own.</li>
          <li>If there are different personalities and learning styles, it can lead to frustration and conflict</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>  
      <h1><b>My Reflections</b></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>We talked thru the wireframing piece and discussed what we wanted to have on this web page in advance of going thru the Navigator and Driver role playing</li>	
          <li>It was a good guided pairing session.  We did a good job with both the Navigator and Driver role</li>
          <li>I understood the benefit of pair programmer because while I was driving and coding the web page, my partner helped to identify misspellings and errors</li>
          <li>As a new programmer, I can tell that it will be a great way for me to learn</li>
        </ul>
