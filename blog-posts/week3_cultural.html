    <h1><b>Understanding Your Thinking Style and Learning</b></h1>
    <!-- Why JavaScript? --> 
    <h2><i>What is your thinking and learning style?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Based on my self assessment, I believe that my thinking style is definitely more concrete sequential.  I definitely feel that I think in a more linear and logical way, which means that I tend to read and understand the material first before trying.  The way that my brain processes is that I need to truly understand the concept and what I am doing before actually doing it.</li>
    <li>My learning style follows a multimodal learning preference.  I definitely need to read and understand the subject first.  Also, I am very visual in the sense that I need to see how things work and understand the "why" before I fully understand and grasp the material</li>
    <li>The good thing is that I do have Growth Mindset.  I like to learn and challenge myself.  My personal goal is to always constantly strive to improve myself.  I know that I don't know everything and I am completely open to feedback and criticism. I truly feel that in order to improve, you need to identify and understand your flaws and figure out way to improve.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <!-- Struggles --> 
    <h2><i>What has been the biggest struggle for you?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>My biggest struggle thus far has been trying to balance reading thru all the material and understanding everything vs. understanding just enough to work thru the weekly challenges.  Thus far, I have leaned toward the latter and just understanding enough due to time constraint because of my work load with Phase 0 and my daily full time job</li>
    <li>I have been struggling to spread out the challenges throughout the week due to traveling for work.  My goal and approach to Phase 0 has been to work 2-3 per day, but in the past couple of weeks, I have been traveling a lot for work and as result, it has been relatively difficult to maintain a steady schedule.</li>    
    </ul><br>   
 
     <!-- Reasons for Struggles --> 
    <h2><i>Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Ideally, I would like to sit down and read thru all the material and truly understand all the concepts before tackling the challenges.  However, due to my work schedule and time constraint, I have been skimming thru the material and just reading and researching just enough to do the challenges</li>
    <li>Mainly, the struggle has been juggling the right balance of time and effort to learning the material between Phase 0, full time job, and traveling for work.</li>
    <li>Fortunately, I am pretty flexible and can adapt.  So, I think that I have been doing a fairly decent job keeping up with the weekly challenges while learning the concept and materials more or less.  If I had more time, I definitely would spend more time on the challenges, but I have accepted that for Phase 0, my goal is to learn the material and be comfortable with the material to tackle the challenges while not trying to understand everything.  It's a little bit against my principle, but I definitely learned and realized that I need to maintain a healthy balance.    
    </ul><br> 

     <!-- Plan of Attack - How to Overcome Struggles? --> 
    <h2><i>What are some ways that you can overcome struggle and expand the way you learn and think?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I definitely see the benefit of learning by pairing with others in my accountability team.  It's a more streamline way of learning and in many ways, it's more productive and we can learn from each other.  I will try to do more pairing sessions each week.</li>
    <li>I will also try to leverage the available tutor hours to better understand the concepts or ideas that I am struggling with. </li>
    <li>Continue to be very structure and maintain a steady schedule where I am spending between 2-3 hours per day on Phase 0.  I find myself less stressful and more refresh trying to learn materials in a 2-3 hour block rather than trying to cram everything within a few days and stressing out.</li>
