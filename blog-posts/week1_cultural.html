    <ul>
    <li>What's your take on the DBC experience?</li>
    <p>You need to go into DBC with an open mindset and attitude of a creator mindset where you will need to define and control what you are going to get out of Dev Bootcamp. You need to have a mindset to take control of the experience at Dev Bootcamp. There will be an initial fear on where and how you fit into Dev Bootcamp.  YOu will question and ask yourself the following: Are you not good enough, are you too good, etc.?  You should come in DBC with some fear, but it should not overwhelm you.  Embrace the change, chaos, and try to get the most of the experience. Dev Bootcamp will be challenging and can be frustrating at time since there will be so much material to learn in such a short period of time, but if you come with an open mindset and looking to learn, it will be a rewarding experience. </p>
    <li>What is your impression of DBC?</li>    
    <p>You need to have a creator mindset from the standpoint that you need to have control of your experience at Dev Bootcamp rather than expecting a nice and pretty package that everything will be delivered and presented to you.  There will be some chaos and not totally structured, but you need to embrace and accept it.  Low percentage of students typically drop out of Dev Bootcamp, probably around 5%.  However, the phase 0 prep will provide a good foundation for phase 1 to help you be setup for success. DBC is different from other coding bootcamps in that it will teach you things around empathy, learning to present your ideas and questions, accepting feedback, and concepts and best practice approach rather than just coding. </p>
    <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
    <p>I have worked in similar chaotic and not so structured environments in the past and had to adapt and quickly pivot and learn new things, whether it’s new technology, business model, etc,, so from that standpoint, I think that I will fit into the Dev Bootcamp environment.  I am also pretty open to feedback and criticism as a way to improve and get better rather than being a negative.  From what i can tell from the prep and video, it’s a pretty big on feedback and guidance, which I am a big fan of.</p>
    <li>Have your expectations of DBC changed?</li>
    <p>My expectation of DBC hasn’t changed.  It reinforces what I had already anticipated.  I already realizes that it’s going to be challenging, frustrating at times, but rewarding at the same time.  You will get out of DBC based on what effort you put into it.</p>    
    <li>If so, how?</li>
    <p>None</p>    
    <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</li>
    <p>Yes</p>    
    <li>Does it make you nervous?</li>
    <p>I am excited, but at the same time, I am a little nervous.  But, going thru Phase 0 prep will help to ease the nervousness and help me to feel more prepared for DBC</p></ul><br>
