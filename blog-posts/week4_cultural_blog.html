    <h1><b>Declining Social and Communication Skills In Tech World</b></h1>
    <!-- Identify a problem facing the tech world --> 
    <h2><i>Social Problem In Tech World</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>In recent years due to the advancement of technology such as smartphones and other social mediums such as Instagram, Facebook, face to face communication has taken a back seat and seen a dramatic decline as more convenient communication channels are made available.</li>
    <li>Excessive communication through technology has been shown in studies to affect people's social skills and cause some anxiety issues with people</li>
    <li>In fact, based on my own personal experience, people rarely, if ever, talk on the phone anymore.  Communication is now either via text messages, instant messaging, Facebook, and other online communication with little or no social interaction.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <!-- Background/Problem --> 
    <h2><i>Why Is This A Problem?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Because of the lack of social communication skills, there is much more miscommunication, which often leads to frustation and tremendous inefficiency in resolving an issue or problem.</li>
    <li>Lack of social skills typically translates to lower attention span, which can be an issue especially if you are working and collaborating with other people at work that are dependent on your contribution.</li>    
    </ul><br>   
 
     <!-- Solutions --> 
    <h2><i>How Can We Solve This Problem?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>We need to reinforce developing social and communication skills at an early age.  We need to encourage children to interact with others and keep them away from smartphone, iPad, computer, etc.</li>
    <li>In the work environment, management also needs to encourage direct face-to-face communications.  There are so many ways to hide in this technology driven society, but management needs to discourage that.  This will help to develop both a collaborative and positive working environment.</li>
    <li>Peer pairing sessions in coding environment is a great and prime example of how better communication can lead to more effective solution by forcing the developers to better and more effectively communicate their ideas and solutions to other developers.  In the technology world, developers are commonly very independent and isolated.  But, with peer pairing, developers are now forced to collaborate with each other in a way that they are not used to.  Although some developers may find that peer paring is an impediment in the beginning, in most cases, most developers benefit because the developers can potentially learn other techniques or methods of solving a problem that he/she would not have thought of.  In addition, this approach forces the developer to better explain and communicate their ideas and thoughts, which will result in better efficiency and better solutions.</li>
