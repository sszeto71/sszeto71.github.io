    <h1><b>Asking the right questions</b></h1>
    <h2><i>Why asking the right questions is important?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Frustration will come along with learning something new and challenging, such as coding.  Inevitably, you will need help from other people, either other students, mentors, or teachers.  The ability to convey your frustration and explain the problems/issues that you are facing will be critical for your success in both Dev Bootcamp, personal life, and professional career.</li> 
    <li>It is important to ask the right questions to get the answers that you want.  Otherwise, you will get responses that won't help to solve your problem.</li>
    <li>Ask the wrong questions and you will get the wrong answers!</li>   
    </ul>

    <h2><i>Tips on asking the right questions</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Provide context on why you are asking the question.  What is the problem that you are trying to solve and why?</li> 
    <li>Be specific and provide details to ensure that there is no ambiguity in your question.  A good question, if asked the right way, should not confuse other people.  It doesn't mean that other people will know the answer, but they will know exactly what you are asking and trying to solve.</li>
    <li>Ask your questions in a way that anyone can understand.  In other words, try to simplify the question and use words and language that convey what you are asking but also easy for others to understand.</li>
    <li>Be ready to ask follow up questions for clarification.  A single question and answer may not do the trick.  It's important to probe and ask follow up questions to get the answer that you are looking for if the initial responses do not address your questions.</li>   
    </ul>
