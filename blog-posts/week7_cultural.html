    <h1><b>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</b></h1>
    <!-- What is Stereotype Threat? --> 
    <h2><i>Exploring your values</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values and qualities come to mind</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Accomplishment, Achievement, Confidence, Enthusiasm, Excellence, Growth, Personal Development, Meaningful, Self-respect</li>     
    </ul> 
    <li>Most important value = 'Personal Development'</li>
    <ul>
    <li>At this stage of my life and career, it's important to continue to grow, learn, and have both career/personal development.</li>
    <li>Currently, I have a good and stable job that I am exceling at.  However, I feel that I am not growing and not learning anything new and I feel that I am not challenged as I should and want to be.</li>
    <li>The main reason why I am taking Dev Bootcamp is that I want to learn how to code and feel that the ability to code will help me and further enhance my career, whether I build my own company or work for another company.</li>             
    </ul>       
    </ul>

    <!-- Advise --> 
    <h2><i>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The last topic that someone asked me for my advice on was around reviewing their new website.  My friend is trying to start a new consulting company and wanted my advice on whether the content on the website promoted him well and helped him stay out from other consulting companies.  He wanted my advice on how to better target his audience and show the values and differentiators that he wanted to easily convey from his website.
    </li>
    </ul>  

    <h2><i>Values and Stereotype threat</i></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>How do you feel when you think about your values?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>I constantly try to remind myself and live by these values.  I judge myself on whether I am living to these values and if not, how I better myself and what can I do to live up to these values.</li>     
    </ul> 
    <li>Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>I am a pretty open person having lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and being a minority myself, I like to think that I am personally color blind and do not judge or sterotype</li>             
    </ul>
    <li>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>None at this time, but I am sure that I can come up with ways to keep myself positive during DBC.  By nature, I am a pretty positive person.</li>      </ul>           
    </ul>
