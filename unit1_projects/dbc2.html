        <li>Know and Understand the <span>Audience</span> That You Are Presenting to</li>
        <div>
            <p>Before presenting or demoing a soluton, you need to understand the makeup of the audience that you are presenting to.  You need to understand their roles, what specific needs and/or challenges that they are facing, their expectations.  The biggest mistake is presenting technial content that is related to the audience's expectations or issues.</p>
        </div>    
        <li>Make the <span>Technical Content</span> Non Technical</li>
        <div>
            <p>It may sounds counterintuitive to make technical content non technical, but what I am suggesting is that you dumb down the material so that any person will undertstand the material.  Instead of using technical jargon, use language that the audience will understand.  If you are presenting to a marketing audience, use marketing terms so that even though you are solving their problem in a technical way, the end result is that you are solving their problems.  Non technical people like visuals, so use as much visuals and graphs as you can to present your story and content.</p>
        </div>    
        <li><span>Tell A Compelling Story</span></li>
        <div>
            <p>If you need to demo a product or technical solution to a non technical audience, you need to relate to the audience by telling them a story or sitation that is relevent to their role or business.  A successful demo will not only show the audience how they can solve their problem with the product, but convey to them how they can easily get from here to there to minimize any concerns that they may have.</p>
